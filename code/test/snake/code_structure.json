{"plan": "The project is a simple Snake game implemented in a single HTML file. The game will initialize with a snake of length 1 and a randomly placed apple. The snake will grow when it eats the apple, and the game will end if the snake collides with itself or the wall. The game will be won if the snake fills the entire map. The game will be controlled using the keyboard arrow keys.", "Files": [{"path": "root", "fname": "index.html", "objectName": "SnakeGame", "functionList": ["initialize_game(map_size)", "create_snake(initial_length)", "spawn_apple(map_size, snake_body)", "update_snake_position(snake_body, direction)", "check_collision(snake_head, map_size, snake_body)", "check_apple_collision(snake_head, apple_position)", "grow_snake(snake_body)", "check_victory(snake_body, map_size)", "handle_input(current_direction, input_key)", "render_game(map_size, snake_body, apple_position)", "game_over()", "game_victory()"]}]}
